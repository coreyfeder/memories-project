# Codealong > Client

Installed with Vite.

Apparently Installed:
-

Installed:
- axios
- @mui/system
- @mui/material
- @mui/icons-material
- moment
- redux (even though I have "react-redux"?)
- redux-thunk (not thunk?)
- @mui/styles ... and I'm _pissed_ about it.
    - deprecated, should be able to use /system somehow. something about changing the import and then using `sx=` instead of `className=` ?? or maybe (from docs) `sx=({...})` instead of `style="..."` ?? [https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/]


May need:
- chunks
- react-file-base64
    - this is aaaaaaancient and full of security holes?
        - hang on, I bet there's something in @mui for this...
